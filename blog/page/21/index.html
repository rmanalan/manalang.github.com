  <div class="entry-content">Happy New Year!  Sorry I&#8217;m six days late.  I&#8217;ve been struggling to get back into my groove since getting back from the Philippines.

Just ran into this article via the <a href="http://www.photographyblog.com/comments.php?id=P1493_0_1_0">PhotographyBLOG</a>&#8230; it&#8217;s a great comparison between the Mac and PC in terms of processing speed for digital photography tasks.  I&#8217;ve been itching at getting a Mac as our next home computer, but maybe I&#8217;ll wait.  Aside from OS X and the cool looking machines, it&#8217;s still slightly behind the PC when it comes to speed.

<blockquote>[via <a href="http://www.robgalbraith.com/bins/multi_page.asp?cid=7-6451-6423" title="Conclusion">Rob Galbraith DPI: A report on processing performance</a>]
Though we haven&#8217;t published specific performance numbers for laptops in this report, we did run a Mac Powerbook and a Dell laptop through a subset of the same tests. The 15-inch Powerbook G4, powered by a G4/1.25GHz processor, was thumped in every test by a Dell Inspiron 8500 and its P4-M processor running at 2.6GHz. Until Apple is able to stuff a G5 processor inside one of its sexy Powerbook cases, portable Macs are likely to remain noticeably slower than their PC counterparts.

  <div class="entry-content">The next big innovation in the digital camera industry has nothing to do with increased mega pixels, larger CCDs, or faster image processors.  I think the next big thing in digital photography is GPS technology embedded right into the camera.

This past Summer, <a href="http://manalang.com/archives/2003/06/15/garmin_rhino_120.php">I bought a GPS receiver</a> for use with <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/faq/">Geocaching</a>.  And at some point after that, I began to wonder about the technology and how pervasive it has become with today&#8217;s latest automobiles.  I like the idea of having a navigation system in my car, but realistically, I probably wouldn&#8217;t use it as often as the manufacturer would lead me to believe.  Plus, I just hate the idea of something else that can distract me from driving safely &#8211; I think DVD players, non-hands free cell phones, and other gizmos that take a driver&#8217;s focus away from the responsibility from driving safely should stay out of the car.

Being a digital photography enthusiast, I bring my camera with me almost everywhere I go.  I like the idea of being able to capture the moment (whatever moment that is) instantly without the cost of film.  Plus, the fact that digital cameras have the ability to record the technical information about a photo is intriguing to me.  A few years ago, my wife and I took a six week trip around Europe.  Between us, we took close to a thousand photos during the six week excursion.  However, at the time, we took our film based SLRs.  I discovered many drawbacks to using film even though the photos turned out amazing.  One of the biggest drawbacks is not just about not having any technical information about the photos, but also not remembering where some of the photos were taken.  After a few years, I pulled the photos back out of the shoe box they&#8217;re now kept in.  And without immediately tagging and indexing the photos, I can&#8217;t recollect where some of them were taken.

Now, consider this &#8211; if I had a GPS enabled digital camera at the time, I wouldn&#8217;t have to care about tagging and indexing these photos after they&#8217;ve been developed.  The camera would have created EXIF or IPTC headers that told me not just the technical data about the photos, but also the exact coordinates of where the individual photos were taken.  Now imagine if there was a free web service that allowed me to pull in location information based on a set of GPS coordinates.  Also, imagine if there was software that allowed you to download location information and add it directly to your photos IPTC headers.  The information could be basic city, state/province, or country details or be more detailed information about where you actually were.  For example, if I took photos in the Vatican, the service would actually deliver information to me about the Vatican.  Now that&#8217;s a killer application!

So, I decided to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=mozclient&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=GPS+Enabled+Digital+Camera">search Google</a> to see if anyone&#8217;s thought of this before.  And so I find out that my idea isn&#8217;t very original.  The first hit I got was from <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/007342.php">Gizmodo pointing to Ricoh&#8217;s  WiFi/Bluetooth/GPS enabled camera</a>.  Oh well, so much for the possibility of being original.  However, I do think that many digital cameras will eventually evolve to this.  I just hope it happens sooner rather than later.

In the meantime, I&#8217;ll settle for a decently priced digital SLR that will allow me to use my Nikkor lenses&#8230; <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0312/03120301nikond70.asp">the Nikon D70</a>.

  <div class="entry-content">A few months ago, I wrote about a <a href="http://manalang.com/archives/2003/07/23/dog_violence.php">frightening experience</a> with our dog (<a href="http://manalang.com/archives/2003/06/10/the_truman_show_part_i.php">Truman</a>) getting attacked.  Earlier this week on the drive in to work, we heard <a href="http://www.kqed.org/.stream/real/radio/perspectives/2003/12/2003-12-01-perspectives.rm.ram" title="KQED | Programs A-Z: Perspectives: Broadcasts">Leslie Gordon&#8217;s (a San Francisco citizen) perspective on violent dogs and their owners</a> [via <a href="http://www.kqed.org/programs/program-archive.jsp?progID=RD62&amp;ResultStart=11&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;type=radio">KQED.org</a>].  Her comments were triggered by <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/11/24/BAGLV39DJD1.DTL">a recent dog attack in Golden Gate Park</a> where a pit bull badly hurt a police horse, an officer, and the dog walker.

  <div class="entry-content">When I was hosting this site on my own server at home, I had <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mod-gzip/">mod_gzip</a> and <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/mod_deflate.html">mod_deflate</a> installed.  But since I switched to a 3rd party host (<a href="http://www.modhost.com">modhost</a> &#8211; great host by the way&#8230; cheap too!) I no longer had the ability to compress my HTML before it went out to a user&#8217;s browser.

By the way, for those of you who don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about, compressing your pages before it streams to the browser can increase the speed of your page load time for users on slower connections.  The size of an HTML page can go down quite a bit &#8211; this page went from around 30kb to ~7kb after it&#8217;s been compressed.

Without mod_gzip or mod_deflate, what&#8217;s one to do?  Well, luckily, my pages are written in <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a>.  PHP has a function (<a href="http://us4.php.net/manual/en/function.ob-gzhandler.php" title="ob_gzhandler - Manual">ob_gzhandler</a>) that will compress your page for you.  The nice thing about ob_gzhandler is that it first determines what type of content encoding the browser will accept (&#8220;gzip&#8221;, &#8220;deflate&#8221;, or none at all) and will return it&#8217;s output accordingly.  So, by enabling this, all browsers are still supported.  Below is an example of how this works:

<code>


<p>This should be a compressed page.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">Earlier this week, <a href="http://www.megnut.com">megnut</a> <a href="http://www.megnut.com/foodrestaurants/007579.asp">pointed to</a> a <a href="http://www.jamieoliver.com">Jamie Oliver</a> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/dining/OLIVER_RECIPES.html">recipe for Braised Ligurian Chicken</a> on the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com">New York Times</a>.   So, we decided to try this out tonight.  We haven&#8217;t eaten it yet, so I&#8217;ll have to hold off on the review &#8211; but, it does look good.  <strong>Update:</strong> It&#8217;s a keeper.  The flavor and essence of this dish is amazing.  If you get a chance, try this recipe.

[[posterous-content:CFloDuoJtdqbElhwsBbs]]

The problem with food pictures is that even it looks good in pictures, you still can&#8217;t get a sense for how it smells.  This dish is oozing of a complex aroma of wine, rosemary, and a olives.

Just in case the recipe disappears from the NY Times website, here it is again:

  <div class="entry-content"><img src="/images/media_httpmanalangcomwpcontentmynewdesktopthumbjpg_ndazqHFofboehgJ.jpg" alt="The Poorman&#8217;s OS X" />

This past weekend, I happened about an <a href="http://store.apple.com">Apple store</a> in my neighborhood.  I finally got to test drive OS X a little bit &#8211; yeah, yeah, I&#8217;m a little behind ok.  Anyway, as someone who learned how to use a computer on the Mac back in the early 90&#8217;s, I don&#8217;t really have a desire to go back.  I&#8217;m not saying Windows is more superior nor is Linux better, but for me, aside from the Mac&#8217;s look and feel, I don&#8217;t see why Mac users practically have orgasms when a new release of OS X comes out.  Come on.

To me, Macs are over-priced.  Plus, there&#8217;s just too much stuff that doesn&#8217;t run on a Mac that I absolutely can&#8217;t do my work without.  If I want a Unix style system, I can have one for free&#8230; Linux.  Which brings me to the topic of this post.  The image above is the latest desktop on my home Linux machine.  I installed <a href="http://www.ximian.com/">Ximian&#8217;s</a> new <a href="http://www.ximian.com/products/desktop/">desktop</a> which is a modified version of <a href="http://www.gnome.org">Gnome</a> and applied an Aqua-like theme to it.  This just goes to show that you don&#8217;t have to shell out beaucoup bucks to get a Mac.  Just take one of your Windows machines and install a Linux distro on it, and  you&#8217;re off.

  <div class="entry-content"><a href="http://www.prospect.org/print/V14/10/tomasky-m.html" title="Vol 14, Iss. 10. The Clinton Formula. Michael Tomasky.">Here&#8217;s an excellent interview of former President Bill Clinton</a> by <a href="http://www.prospect.org/authors/tomasky-m.html">Michael Tomasky</a> for <a href="http://www.prospect.org/">The American Prospect</a>.

<blockquote>Now what we [the Democrats] should say is that they [the Republicans], not we, have brought class warfare back to America. You know, every time I complain about these tax cuts some conservative says I&#8217;m practicing class warfare. I am not. I pay these taxes. And I live in New York state and Westchester County, so I think I probably pay as high [of] rates as anybody in America. And I should. Nobody makes me live in this country. America has been good to me. And I think for somebody to give me a tax cut and then turn around and say, &#8220;We&#8217;ve gotta have $87 billion spent in Iraq, but we&#8217;re gonna kick 300,000 kids out of after-school programs, 84,000 kids out of student loans &#8230; 25,000 uniformed police off the street? We&#8217;re gonna kick a couple thousand police off the street in New York City who put their lives on the line on September the 11th, and they&#8217;re gonna give me a tax cut?&#8221; That&#8217;s class warfare! And I think we ought to say that!</blockquote>

I saw President Clinton speak at one of our conferences in 2002.  Put aside the Lewinsky scandal, I still love the guy.  I sure hope Clark and Dean read <a href="http://www.prospect.org/print/V14/10/tomasky-m.html">this article</a>.  Clinton&#8217;s advice is right on the money.  If any democrat is going to win in 2004, they need to &#8220;Defend government.  Fight Smarter. Smile.&#8221;
