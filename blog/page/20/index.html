  <div class="entry-content">When <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/">Six Apart</a> announced the new <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/corner/archives/2004/05/its_about_time.shtml">Movable Type licensing and pricing options</a> a few weeks ago, many in the blogosphere went nuts.  I personally don&#8217;t see anything wrong with paying for great software like Movable Type, but many bloggers apparently do.  Many of those <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/05/14/freedom-0">unhappy users</a> have turned against Six Apart and moved on to other options &#8211; primarily <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>.  One thing we learned from <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2004/05/19/moving_forward">Six Apart&#8217;s blunder</a> is that it&#8217;s tough to turn loyal users into loyal paying customers.

Throughout these past few weeks, WordPress has enjoyed <a href="http://photomatt.net/archives/2004/05/24/slashdot-again/">quite a bit of press time</a>.  And because I&#8217;m a curious user, I decided to see if WordPress is a better option for me than Movable Type.  So, over the weekend, I decided to try switching this site over to WordPress.  I&#8217;m happy to say that it was a breeze.  It would have taken me only a few minutes to switch over if my weblog was simpler.  However, when this site was running on Movable Type, I had three separate weblogs configured just to build this site (one for the masthead, daily links, and the standard weblog).  It was a mess to manage in MT.  I&#8217;m sure there might have been a cleaner way to construct this site in MT but I did it the way I knew how at the time.

Now that this site runs on WordPress, the masthead (the image viewer shown above), the daily links (renamed to <a href="http://manalang.com/archives/category/etcetera-etcetera/">Etcetera&#8230; etcetera&#8230;</a>), and the main weblog are all part of the same WordPress weblog.  The toughest part of the switch was having to stitch together the three MT weblogs into one.  I also spent quite a bit of time on a mini-redesign and also implemented <a href="http://photomatt.net/archives/2004/05/19/asides/">Matt&#8217;s &#8220;asides&#8221; customization</a>.  On the path to switching, I ended up writing two WordPress <a href="http://wiki.wordpress.org/index.php/PluginAPI">plugins</a> which I&#8217;ll publish soon.

Throughout the process, I took a mental note of what I like about WordPress:

* No rebuilding&#8230; everything&#8217;s dynamic
* Fast posting and editing
* A better option if you don&#8217;t have much space available with your host &#8211; after I switched, I noticed that I saved almost 40 MB of space
* PHP is easier than Perl &#8211; took me about ten minutes to write my first plugin
* Active developer community

In defense of my motives for switching, I didn&#8217;t swtich over because it&#8217;s the cool thing to do.  Frankly, I think <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/05/14/freedom-0">the Freedom 0 idea</a> is overrated &#8211; the good thing is that we all have a choice.  I switched because WordPress, in my opinion, provides a better fit for my needs.  I don&#8217;t feel differently about Movable Type, in fact, I&#8217;m going to continue using it on some of my other projects.

Aside from that, this site has been WordPress&#8217;d!

  <div class="entry-content">After reading the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000119312504073639/ds1.htm">Google S1</a> a bit, I was particularly intrigued by <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000119312504073639/ds1.htm#toc16167_1">Larry Page&#8217;s letter</a> to potential shareholders of Google.  John Battelle has a great summary on his <a href="http://battellemedia.com/" title="John Battelle's Searchblog">site</a>.

<blockquote>[via <a href="http://battellemedia.com/" title="John Battelle's Searchblog">John Battelle&#8217;s Searchblog</a>]
The letter states, among other things, that 1. We don&#8217;t need to do this for the money; 2. We have no plans to run our business to satisfy Wall Street&#8217;s need for smooth earnings predictability; 3. We plan to give no earnings guidance, not at least as it&#8217;s understood on Wall St.; 4. Don&#8217;t ask us to do so, we&#8217;ll simply decline the request; 5. We&#8217;ll do odd things that you won&#8217; t understand; 6. We will make big bets on things that may not work out; 7. We run the company as a triumvirate, so there will not be clear leadership from one person like most other companies; 8. We bridge the media and tech industries (interesting), which are in flux, so we&#8217;ve chosen a two-class stock structure similar to the NYT, WashPost, and WSJ that helps us avoid being taken over by those forces; 9. We plan using an auction model, as it feels fairer and we understand auctions from AdWords; 10. Don&#8217;t invest in us if this scares you at all, or the price feels too high; 11. Don&#8217;t even think about asking us to cut expenses with regard to our employees; 12. We believe in the idea of Don&#8217;t Be Evil; 13. It&#8217;s evil to pay for placement or inclusion (a swipe at Yahoo); 14. We hope to bridge the digital divide through Gmail type free services and a foundation with at least 1% of profits and equity to help make the world a better place; 17. Betting on Google is a bet on Sergey and Larry (this was said multiple times, making me wonder if there wasn&#8217;t some odd future blame being assigned here by the VCs or bankers); 18. This letter is our way of answering the questions we can&#8217;t answer in the coming months due to the IPO quiet period.</blockquote>

As edgy as Larry&#8217;s letter sounds (particularly to those on Wall Street who it partially addresses), I appreciate the founders&#8217; rosy idea of how the publicly owned Google will operate.  I just hope they can survive on these principles without succumbing to the pressures of Wall Street like most companies.

Here&#8217;s some more commentary from John Battelle:

<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">While my summary of the letter may sound negative, it&#8217;s my honest and initial response: to me, the letter comes off pretty strong, and likely will anger many on Wall Street. But I have to commend the founders for sticking to their beliefs, and using the IPO as something of a megaphone/soapbox. It is brave, unique, and rather commendable to very publicly state that the founders are controlling the company, and the founders will decide what is best for Google, not Wall Street. They&#8217;ve set themselves a very high long-term bar, claiming they will best the system, in essence. I think it will be very interesting to see how Wall Street responds. There is a chance, in the end, that the Street will feel slighted, and turn its back on the company.</blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><em><strong>Update:</strong> this post is broken due to my move over to WordPress.  I&#8217;ll be building a similar plugin for WordPress.  MT users&#8230; sorry.</em>

A few months ago, I wrote about <a href="http://manalang.com/archives/2003/09/29/file_system_generated_photo_gallery" title="File System Generated Photo Gallery">my search for a simple web based photo gallery</a>.  Since then, I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://qdig.sourceforge.net">Qdig</a>.  Qdig is a basic photo gallery that is dynamically generated based on images stored in one or more directories.  It will auto generate the image navigation, resize your images, and create your thumbnails.  No need for a database or any fancy settings.  Qdig is basically one PHP script that does all of this.

One of the nice features of Qdig I never took advantage of until now is it&#8217;s ability  for it to be &#8221;<a href="http://us4.php.net/manual/en/function.include.php">included</a>&#8221; within other PHP pages.  Since my site runs on PHP, I was able to include Qdig into my entries as an embedded photo gallery.  Like the example below (photos of our bathroom remodel):


To get this to work cleanly with Moveable Type, I created a macro using <a href="http://bradchoate.com/weblog/2002/08/12/mtmacro">Brad Choate&#8217;s MTMacro</a>.

<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">&lt;MTMacroDefine name=&#8221;qdig&#8221; tag=&#8221;qdig&#8221;&gt;
&lt;?php $chroot_dir = &#8220;&lt;MTMacroAttr name=&#8217;path&#8217;&gt;&#8221;;
if (strtolower(&#8220;&lt;MTMacroAttr name=&#8217;normalize&#8217;&gt;&#8221;) == &#8220;true&#8221;) {
   $normalize = &#8220;-normalize&#8221;;
} else {
   $normalize = &#8220;&#8221;;
}
include &#8220;/path_to_qdig_script/qdig.php&#8221;;?&gt;
&lt;/MTMacroDefine&gt;
</blockquote>

This allows me to easily create a quick ad-hoc photo gallery within my entries like the one above by simply using the following markup within my entries:

<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">&lt;qdig path=&#8221;path/to/your/images/&#8221;&gt;</blockquote>

I added the normalize attribute in there to allow me to have ImageMagick convert my images with the &#8220;-normalize&#8221; attribute which transforms images to span the full range of colors found in the photo (similar to the &#8220;Auto-Levels&#8221; command in Photoshop).

To get this to work the way I wanted, I had to modify Qdig a little bit so that the markup tags it created were identified with class names so I could apply some simple CSS to it.  Here&#8217;s the <a href="http://manalang.com/qdig.txt" title="Customize Qdig.php source">qdig.php</a> file with my customizations.  To add the scrollbar effect win the thumbnails, I used the overflow and white-space property in css.  View my <a href="http://manalang.com/styles/styles-site.css">stylesheet</a> if you&#8217;re interested to see how I did it (look in the &#8220;gallery&#8221; section).

Because <a href="http://manalang.com/archives/2003/11/05/undecided" title="Undecided">my original candidates</a> didn&#8217;t make it this far, I&#8217;ve been paying close attention to the primaries hoping another candidate can fill the void.  And since the Iowa caucuses, I&#8217;ve really enjoyed John Edwards&#8217; campaign&#8230; very positive and upbeat &#8211; and sounds like someone who would make a good POTUS.  However, a few weeks ago, my wife forwarded me a link to the <a href="http://www.presidentmatch.com" title="Can't decide which candidate to vote for?  Try this...">Presidential Match</a> website which helps you decide which candidate is best for you based on where you stand on issues currently facing the nation.  The results surprised me.  On top was John Kerry (not that much of a surprise actually), however, John Edwards came in fifth, just above Bush.

[[posterous-content:HwpsDxxtxEIlwgnytkxG]]

After <a href="http://www.presidentmatch.com/Compare.jsp2?idlist=3|5|&amp;invoker=qanda" title="Kerry vs. Edwards side-by-side">comparing the Kerry&#8217;s and Edwards&#8217; side-by-side</a>, I found that the major differences between them were with regards to religion in government, gay rights, and gun control.  I think I might stick with Kerry.

  <div class="entry-content"><a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/">Sam Ruby</a> just <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1716.html">converted to a server-side news aggregator</a> called <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a>.  I like the idea behind server-side news aggregators, and I think that Bloglines is a good implementation of one.  However, after trying it out, I still prefer the <a href="http://fls.moo.jp/moz/rssreader.html">RSS Reader Panel extension</a> that&#8217;s available for <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a>.  I prefer it mainly because it offers me a simple way to scan which articles and sites have been updated right from within the browser.  I also like it&#8217;s small form factor which promotes users to actually visit the website the article or entry originated from instead of reading an entire article in an aggregator.  In the RSS Reader Panel, to see the summary of an article, all I have to do is hover over the titles to see a summary description in a tooltip control.  Here&#8217;s a screenshot of what it looks like.

[[posterous-content:zkjsfrucpoktijcitHgm]]

The RSS Reader Panel has a lot of nice features like the ability to import/export an OPML file, integrated <a href="http://www.feedster.com">Feedster</a> search, Atom feed support, CSS based display of a feed, and the ability to have the browser check for updates to feeds.  I think Bloglines is off to a great start, but I think in order to get my vote, Bloglines should offer a sidebar panel that functions much the same way as the RSS Reader panel &#8211; the biggest differentiator being that Bloglines is server based.

  <div class="entry-content">Just recently, <a href="http://tbray.org/ongoing/">Tim Bray</a> posted <a href="http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/01/31/OneMonthOfAdsense">his experience</a> with the <a href="http://www.google.com/adsense/">Google AdSense</a> program; and just this week, <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/">Jeremy Zawodny</a> has decided to <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/001583.html">join the AdSense fun</a>.  I actually signed up for AdSense when it came out last year, but never implemented it on my site.  I didn&#8217;t add it to my site back then because I didn&#8217;t want advertising on this site.  Also, I wanted to control the look and content of my site without Google getting in my way.  However, after reading <a href="http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/01/31/OneMonthOfAdsense">Tim&#8217;s experience with AdSense</a> and the profit he&#8217;s accumulated after one month, I&#8217;m a bit more encouraged to take AdSense for a spin.  My hosting costs only $48 USD a year&#8230; so it&#8217;s not that much.  I&#8217;m interested to see if AdSense can support the cost of this site entirely.  If it does, I&#8217;ll keep it.  If it doesn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s gone.

This should be an interesting experiment.  Tim has claimed to have made quite a bit off of AdSense:

<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">
&#8220;As of mid-afternoon on the last day of the month my revenue exceeds my typical monthly hosting/bandwidth costs by well over US$500.&#8221;
&#8211;Tim Bray
</blockquote>

He&#8217;s also got a lot more readers than I have.  So, let&#8217;s see if I can make $48 USD a year of off Google.

For three weeks in December 2003, Cindy and I traveled to the Philippines.  The last time I visited was in 1987&#8230; Cindy had never been.  It was an amazing experience getting to know aunts, uncles, and cousins that I haven&#8217;t seen in many years &#8211; and some I&#8217;ve never met.  During our time there, we traveled to seven different islands and got to taste the beauty of the smaller islands like Boracay, Panay, Bohol, and Panglao.  This <a href="/philippines" title="manalang.com: Philippines2003 Photo Album">album</a> is a compilation of all the pictures we took during those three weeks.
