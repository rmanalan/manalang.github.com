  <div class="entry-content">By far this one of the worst weblogs of all time.  If you haven&#8217;t done so already, please take me of off your reading list.

Ever since I added my Daily Links section (on the right) and started my weblog at work, I haven&#8217;t entered a single entry here in almost a month.  I guess I haven&#8217;t had much to write about lately outside of work.  Most of the time I enjoy reading other peoples blogs more than writing in my own.  Maybe that&#8217;s a clue.  Anyway, I think I suffer from writer&#8217;s block when it comes to writing entries in my weblog.  What a waste&#8230; I&#8217;m wasting precious energy and money keeping this webserver running to serve up stale content.  I&#8217;m the epitome of my worse pet pieves&#8230; out-dated websites.

Most of the weblogs I read (the ones in the Daily Reading section on the right) are so well kept up.  Some of the entries are even good.  Yesterday, I read <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?archives/007214.php">a very moving entry</a> by <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/">Anil Dash</a>.  Anyway, I have to get better at this blogging thing.  Too bad it&#8217;s not New Years yet&#8230; otherwise, my New Years resolution would be to be a better blogger.

In the meantime, I&#8217;ve gotta go&#8230; my wife and carpool is waiting&#8230;

  <div class="entry-content"><a href="http://dylan.tweney.com/">Dylan Tweney</a> a technology journalist, writes about <a href="http://www.cio.com/archive/041503/et_article.html">open-source tools and their slow adoption rate by CIOs</a> (<a href="http://www.cio.com/archive/041503/index.html">April 15, 2003 edition</a> of <a href="http://www.cio.com">CIO Magazine</a>).  When IT operating costs are being scrutinized more than ever and downsizing is inevitable, it seems that open-source technologies would be an obvious choice for most CIOs to move to.  However, as Mr. Tweney points out in his article, CIOs are still reluctant to jump on board with the open-source movement.

<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">Although developers may be pushing for open-source tools, CIOs are less enthusiastic, citing concern about support, accountability and potential legal issues.</blockquote>

Check it out&#8230; a good read for those interested in the topic.

  <div class="entry-content">So, we were out walking our dog (<a href="http://manalang.com/archives/2003/06/10/the_truman_show_part_i.html">Truman</a>) around our neighborhood tonight.  Nothing special&#8230; just a typical after dinner walk.  Coming toward us was a lady with two dogs.  The dogs looked like normal dogs (not sure what breed).  As they approached, they slowed down and came to a stop in front of a neighbor&#8217;s garage.  As we walked, Truman looked at the two dogs, but didn&#8217;t approach them and kept walking forward.  Right when we were about to pass by them, one of the dogs, leaped toward Truman then procedded to tear into him.  I tried to pull Truman away, but the other dog had his jaws attached to his side.  Truman was in fear (he&#8217;s a very passive dog).  A few seconds later, the owner of the offensive dog was able to take hold of her dog then pulled it away.

Cindy and I were just in shock.  Luckily, Truman wasn&#8217;t hurt.  The offensive dog&#8217;s bite wasn&#8217;t strong enough to tear into his skin.

So&#8230; we walked away shaken.  The lady who owned the dog was very apologetic.  Apparently, its collar broke off when it leaped at Truman.

As we continued on our walk, we were wondering why anyone would want to own an aggressive dog.  This isn&#8217;t the first time Truman&#8217;s come close to being mauled by an aggressive dog.  And this isn&#8217;t the first time I&#8217;ve heard of horror stories of violent aggressive dogs (<a href="http://dir.yahoo.com/Government/Law/Cases/San_Francisco_Dog_Mauling_Trial/">remember Diane Whipple?</a>).

In light of tonight&#8217;s events, I&#8217;ve written a letter to owners of <a href="http://www.thetimesherald.com/news/stories/20010404/localnews/438942.html">violent dogs</a>:

<blockquote>To Owners of Aggressive and Violent Dogs:

Tonight, our dog almost got mauled by a dog similar to yours.  I kindly ask that if you plan to walk &#8220;Killer&#8221; that you do so in a neighborhood far away from ours.  If for some reason, you happen to be walking in our neighborhood, please observe the following rules:

# If you&#8217;re walking toward us (a couple with a nice happy golden retriever), please cross over to the other side of the street.  The people with the passive friendly dog should have the right of way.  Because your dog is a lethal weapon, it needs to be handled carefully and taken away from anything it can possibly hurt.
# Always keep a leash on your dog!  You may want to invest in a thick chain or cable.  A strong dog with killer instincts is bound to break off of a nylon leash.

If I happen to run into you, and you and your dog are not obeying these rules, you may find yourselves getting whacked by a golf club.

Sincerely,
Rich Manalang
A Friendly Dog Owner</blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><img src="/images/media_httpmanalangcomwpcontentgeominilogogif_hEgrGigatbcghub.gif" alt="Geocaching: Pleasure Hunt" />A great article about geocaching was published last Friday by the San Francisco Chronicle: <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/07/11/CC281007.DTL" title="Pleasure Hunt / 'Geocaching' buccaneers pursue hidden bounty throughout Bay Area as GPS-based game catches on">Pleasure Hunt / &#8216;Geocaching&#8217; buccaneers pursue hidden bounty throughout Bay Area as GPS-based game catches on</a>.  It reminded me that I forgot to log the caches we found up at Tahoe <a href="http://manalang.com/archives/2003/06/27/homewood_bound.html">when we were there a few weeks ago</a>.  We found <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?ID=27935">this</a> and <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?ID=26196">this</a> but came up short on <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?wp=GC15A3">this</a>.

<img src="/images/media_httpmanalangcomwpcontentlogoappgif_zonCazHstaqboJn.gif" alt="Mister Smarty&#8230; my other blog" />Well&#8230; not really.  I&#8217;m testing out <a href="http://www.sixapart.com">Six Apart&#8217;s</a> new hosted blogging service called <a href="http://www.typepad.com/">TypePad</a> &#8211; which is in its second beta test round.  So far, so good.  TypePad is actually very cool.  I&#8217;m impressed at <a href="http://www.typepad.com/photoalbum.html">how nice the user interface</a> is.  And underneath, it&#8217;s looks like it&#8217;s a highly tricked-out version of MT.  Support for photo albums, Amazon lists, and other cool features come right out of the box.  The biggest improvement over MT I&#8217;ve seen, however, is the new template designer.  Non HTML/CSS knowledgeable users will be able to customize their blogs with ease.

So, for now, <a href="http://manalang.com">this</a> is still my blog home.  But you never know, <a href="http://mena.typepad.com">Mena</a>, Ben, and <a href="http://anil.typepad.com/anil/">Anil</a> are cooking up some good mojo.  I have no doubt that this will be better than what Pyra/Google is coming up with&#8230; <a href="http://mena.typepad.com/dollarshort/2003/07/aol_journals.html">AOL&#8217;s no match either</a>.

  <div class="entry-content"><strong>Today on mozillaZine:</strong> <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=3422" title="AOL Cuts Remaining Mozilla Hackers">AOL Cuts Remaining Mozilla Hackers</a>

Hmmm&#8230; I wonder what this means for the remaining organizations out there that are still running on Netscape browsers.  Hopefully, it means that software companies who spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to support Netscape 4.x won&#8217;t have to do that anymore.  Thankfully, the Mozilla project will continue under the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/press/mozilla-foundation.html">new</a> <a href="http://www.mozillafoundation.org/">Mozilla Foundation</a>, a non-profit that will serve as the new home of <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">mozilla.org</a>.  Looks like this new foundation is off to a great start with funding guaranteed from AOL ($2M over the next two years) and other industry leaders, Mitch Kapor, the new Chairman of the Mozilla Foundation, is making a personal contribution of $300K, and Red Hat and Sun Microsystems are also planning on ponying up.

The desired effect of this is that software companies who have to support Netscape 4.x, will no longer have to.  However, an undesireable reprecussion is that developers might begin to target Internet Explorer again.  That would be a huge problem.  Although, with the next release of Mozilla (currently dubbed <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firebird/">Firebird</a>) looming around the corner and Safari becoming the most popular browser for Macs, the chances of developers focusing on Internet Explorer are probably not as good&#8230; especially since we&#8217;re probably <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/cgi-bin/mt/mezzo/archives/000171.asp">stuck with Internet Explorer 6 for the next 3+ years</a>.

  <div class="entry-content">Right now (7:20PM PST), I&#8217;m sitting in my backyard enjoying a beer with my wife and dog nearby.  The grill is fired up with some veggies cooking and a halibut fillet waiting on deck.  The suckiest part about this is after I post this, I have to finish up my work&#8230; luckily I can do it from the convenience of my backyard supported by my wireless connection to work.  I guess it doesn&#8217;t suck that much.

<strong>Update:</strong> might need a <a href="http://www.intel.com/home/notebook/Centrino/index.htm?iid=ihc+home_body_icmt">Centrino</a> based laptop someday&#8230; battery life on my current Tecra sucks.

  <div class="entry-content">Since I&#8217;ve installed <a href="http://www.moveabletype.org">MoveableType</a>, I&#8217;ve been impressed with its flexibility to be more than just a simple little blog tool.  In many cases, MT can be extended to manage a complete website not just a weblog.  For those who haven&#8217;t figured out how to do this&#8230; you&#8217;re in luck.  Finally, someone has written a guide on how to extend MT beyond the blog.  <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/about.blah">Matt Haughey</a>, creator of <a href="http://www.metafilter.com">MetaFilter</a>, just published an article entitled <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/features.blah/entry/007162" title="A Whole Lotta Features">&#8220;Beyond the Blog&#8221;</a>.  This article delves into what it takes to build an entire <em>non-blog</em> website with MT.  A very good read for MTers.

  <div class="entry-content">So, Cindy and I celebrated our first year of marriage this weekend&#8230; woo-hoo!  On Saturday night, we decided to go to <a href="http://www.farallonrestaurant.com/">Farallon</a> &#8211; an interesting seafood restaurant in San Francisco known for it&#8217;s cool ambiance.  Anyway, luckily, we were seated in probably the best table in the house (a small intimate booth upstairs).  However, directly in front of us was a table with five very loud people&#8230; two couples and a daughter who was just so into herself.  The tables weren&#8217;t that close to each other, but we literally spent most of the dinner listening to these people.  One of the ladies at the loud table had her legs crossed (indian style).  Now, I&#8217;m not a big fan of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/style/columns/missmanners/">Miss Manners</a> or <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/95/">Emily Post</a> but I do object to poor etiquete at a decently nice restaurant.

Anyway, the food was ok&#8230; my dish (Atlantic cod) was so-so (a little on the bland side).  Cindy liked her bass.
