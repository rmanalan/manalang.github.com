  <div class="entry-content">I didn&#8217;t know this but it appears that <a href="http://www.scripting.com/">Dave Winer</a> had heart bypass surgery a while ago.  Today, he looks back and comments on Bill Clinton&#8217;s surgery based on his own experience.  I&#8217;m sure getting a good look at your mortality can provoke you to live your life very differently.  I wonder how this is going to affect President Clinton.

<blockquote>[via <a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2004/09/09#billClintonsHeart">Dave Winer</a>]
Now imagine the power that Bill Clinton has, one of a handful of living ex-presidents, a rich man, with nothing but possibilities. He could really make a difference. I remember hearing him speak at Davos in 2000, he was an inspiration. Find a shared vision, he said. Indeed. A man of Clinton&#8217;s power, freed of any idea that what he thinks means anything, could really make a difference, and I think he will. But give him a year to work through all the michegas, emotional and physical, before he&#8217;s ready to resume his place in the world, fully.</blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/">Tim Bray</a> just posted an <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/08/19/BackDoor">excellent essay</a> about how to survive as a forward thinking technology company.

<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"><strong>The Front Door and the CIO</strong> I&#8217;ve dealt with quite a few CIOs, and they don&#8217;t think about technology, they think in business terms and those are the only terms they think in. When the SAP salesman says a company can cut acquisition and logistics costs, or the IBM salesman says Notes can get people working together better, nobody thinks much about what the architecture is or how it works or whether programmers like working with it. Both those salesmen came in through the front door.</blockquote>

I think it&#8217;s fair to say that most ERP vendors are front door technology companies.  Regarding the back door:

<blockquote>When I say &#8220;back-door&#8221; technology I mean what the matrix called <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/01/12/TPSM-Programmers">Happy Programmers</a>. The idea is, if the back-room geeks like something, and find that it&#8217;s useful, they&#8217;ll start using it whether management thinks it&#8217;s a good idea or not.</blockquote>

A company running entirely on a back door strategy may not be very focused on the one thing that matters in business, customers.  So, it&#8217;s easy to see that back door companies might have happy R&amp;D teams, but can&#8217;t keep profits up.

<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote"><strong>Building Back-door Tech</strong> First off, there&#8217;s no point trying to do corporate planning on this, you leave the geeks to themselves and it either happens or it doesn&#8217;t.</blockquote>

For Sun (or at least Tim Bray), the back door is about three things:

# Get serious about <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Company/NewsRoom/whitepapers_ADL.plex">dynamic languages</a> &#8211; that is, better adoption of some of the leading open source languages or geek toys, Perl, PHP, Python, etc.  Makes a ton of sense.  If the geeks like the tools they have to use, they&#8217;re more inclined to build better software, and more of it.
# &#8220;Be the first with the most on syndication technology&#8221;
# Capitalize on all of the <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/04/26/WSTandP">WS-*</a> standards emerging

I think all companies, big or small, should be thinking about how to bridge their front and back door strategies.  The alternative is not an option.

<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"><strong>The Alternative</strong> That would be to ignore the back door and decide that if CIO&#8217;s don&#8217;t want it today, our engineers shouldn&#8217;t be working on it. Wait, I&#8217;ve seen that movie before&#8230; it was at a computer company, second-largest in the world when I worked there, called Digital Equipment Corporation. R.I.P. That approach would not only be fatal, it would be boring. Let&#8217;s not do it.</blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content">This past weekend (yes old news), my wife and I spent the weekend on the Mendocino coast &#8211; a 3 hour drive north of San Francisco.  It was a great weekend to unplug and recharge.  Even if we didn&#8217;t want to unplug from the connected world, being in Elk (15 minutes south of Mendocino) forced you to do it.  There&#8217;s no cellular signal or land line where we were, not even a television.  Unlike camping, however, we had a nice room overlooking the Pacific.

On Saturday, we visited the <a href="http://www.gardenbythesea.org/">Mendocino Coast Botanical Gardens</a> in Fort Bragg.  It&#8217;s an amazing garden nestled on 47 acres next to the ocean.  The <a href="http://www.gardenbythesea.org/collections/dahlia.html">dahlia garden</a> was impressive.  Here are some photos I took that day:

  <div class="entry-content">I hate long flights.  It&#8217;s even worse when you&#8217;re flying coach.  I&#8217;m currently headed to Sydney for a four day workshop my team is hosting.  I used to love traveling to far away places for work.  When I started at PeopleSoft back in 1997, my first consulting assignment was a six month gig in Melbourne.  It was a great gig with great people.  I could have stayed longer, but just couldn&#8217;t commit myself to a two year stay.

We just crossed the international dateline.  The problem with these long flights is that I can never get a decent wink of sleep.  Being fairly tall doesn&#8217;t help when cramped into a coach seat.  Business class is not really an option these days.  I don&#8217;t travel enough now to have dispensable airline points to upgrade.  Luckily, I&#8217;m in an isle seat and the seat next to me is empty.  The bad part is across the isle is a family with two small children.  The kid next to me keeps throwing up.  Just a few hours ago, I noticed him gaging and so I quickly got the barf bag in my seat pocket and held it out for him.  However, I was a few seconds too late.  He ended up hurling his dinner into his hands.  I feel sorry for the guy.  He just can&#8217;t seem to keep anything down.  Every once in a while, his little sister screams at the top of her lungs, &#8220;MOMMY!!!  MOMMY!!!&#8221;  I&#8217;m not really bothered by all of this commotion  since I&#8217;m awake and currently not trying to get any sleep.  I just feel sorry for the family.  Traveling on a vacation should not be that difficult.

Another reason I probably can&#8217;t get any sleep on these flights is that I just don&#8217;t like the idea of sleeping amongst strangers.  When I was little, I never took to the idea of group naps.  Although I think naps are great and should be a part of the everyday routine, sleeping with a group of people was just never my thing.

Oh no.  He&#8217;s yakking again.  His mom is now asking others for their barf bags&#8230; he&#8217;s already gone through all the barf bags in the center row.  Poor guy.  I wish I could help them.

Five hours to go.  Time in the Bay Area: 9:32 AM.  Time in Sydney: 2:32 AM.  It&#8217;s going to be a long day.

  <div class="entry-content">Last week&#8217;s news of the Filipinos in Iraq pulling out of their mission early to save one of their own from being beheaded pissed a lot of Americans off.  No one wants to see an ally cave in to the &#8220;evil doers,&#8221; but there&#8217;s more than one side to this story.  I ran into <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2004/07/24#a5453">Philip Greenspun&#8217;s entry</a> about this late last week.  Here&#8217;s what he had to say:

<blockquote>[via <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2004/07/24#a5453">Philip Greenspun: Why are we angry with the Philippines?</a>]
From what I read the Filipinos were in Iraq on a &#8220;humanitarian&#8221; mission.  One of their guys was kidnapped so they went home.  So now we Americans are pissed off that they caved into the demands of the kidnappers/be-headers.  None of the newspaper articles that I saw, however, questioned the original purpose.  Though some Iraqis appear on CNN to complain that they don&#8217;t have air-conditioning and 24/7 running water it is hard to see them as a hardship case in a world where many people have never had A/C or running water.  Shouldn&#8217;t &#8220;humanitarian&#8221; missions go to places where either (a) folks are really doing badly, (b) folks are genuinely grateful for assistance, (c) folks are living right next door to us (charity begins at home), or (d) all of the above?</blockquote>

What most Americans aren&#8217;t recognizing is that the Philippines is a third-world country.  For them to send their own people to perform a &#8220;humanitarian&#8221; mission in someone else&#8217;s country is an act of kindness (or stupidity on President Arroyo&#8217;s part).  These Filipino soldiers should be performing humanitarian missions in their own country.  The Philippines is not like many of America&#8217;s other allies.  They should never have sent their troops to Iraq to begin with.  They might be the Bush Administrations closest ally in Southeast Asia, but under their own circumstances, they should not be required to put that much skin in the game, regardless of whether they really support the American effort in Iraq.  We Americans should understand that.  They&#8217;ve got their own problems.

I&#8217;d like to say that President Arroyo did the right thing with pulling their troops out of Iraq, but really, she never should have sent them.  There are probably as many Filipinos living in poverty and strife in the Philippines as there are in Iraq.  The difference is that Filipinos just aren&#8217;t pissed at us like the terrorists in Iraq.  If Filipinos are going to partake in nation building in someone else&#8217;s country, others should participate in helping them improve the conditions in their country.

  <div class="entry-content">I&#8217;ve been pounding my head trying to figure out a problem with one of our systems at work today.  The problem was that we were running out of threads on our WebLogic 8.1 app server pretty fast.  Last night I made a change to a login form that inconspicuously caused the problem.  Here&#8217;s my form (I&#8217;ve stripped out all of the unnecessary crap):


  <pre>...





...</pre>



I know this isn&#8217;t a great way to submit a form, but I have reasons for doing this.  Take note of the <code>onsubmit</code> event in the form.  This calls out a JavaScript function called <code>genericFunction()</code> that will also do a form submit.  It&#8217;s a bit tricky.  My initial thought was that the <code>onsubmit</code> event takes precedence over the standard form submit, but that&#8217;s where I&#8217;m wrong.  It appears that the form actually fires off two submits in this case, causing multiple calls to your endpoint.

Is this obvious to most people?

  <div class="entry-content"><img src="/images/media_httpmanalangcomwpcontentblogo225x50gif_qdefDtysevtmGBJ.gif" alt="Bloglines v2.0" />Several months ago, <a href="http://manalang.com/archives/2004/02/18/bloglines_vs_rss_reader_panel">I ranted about RSS aggregators</a> and how bulky they were and how I like to read the content of the sites I follow on the original site.  Well, about a month ago, I started to play around with <a href="http://www.sharpreader.net/">SharpReader</a>.  I used SharpReader religiously for a few weeks until I decided to give <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a> another spin.  Since then I&#8217;ve decided that Bloglines is my prefered news reader.  Period.

Today, Bloglines rolled out a new version of their service which sports a new user interface, a personal blog service (probably targeted more to be a link blog like <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>), and some other new  whiz-bang features.  It&#8217;s fast, clean, and highly useful for managing your daily readings.

It makes sense to revisit how you feel about something once in a while.  Otherwise, you may miss out.

  <div class="entry-content"><img src="/images/media_httpimagesamazoncomimagesPB00005JNEG01MZZZZZZZjpg_ggwmznzwFcsJCHg.jpg" alt="Fahrenheit 9/11" />After watching <a href="http://www.fahrenheit911.com/">Fahrenheit 9/11</a> this past weekend, I was motivated to post my thoughts about the film.  However, since there&#8217;s so much buzz about this film everywhere, I&#8217;ve decided to post some excerpts of wonderful reviews and critiques I&#8217;ve read since the movie opened.

By far the best review I&#8217;ve read about Fahrenheit 9/11 has been <a href="http://anthropik.net/ununfahrenheit911">Jason Godesky&#8217;s critique of Christopher Hitchen&#8217;s Slate article</a> entitled &#8221;<a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2102723/">UnFahrenheit 9/11</a>:&#8221;

<blockquote>&#8220;Many criticize Moore for providing no solutions; do these critics really expect one man, one film, to solve all the world&#8217;s problems? Without the right questions, we can never have the right answers; critical questioning forces us to refine our thoughts and ideas, challenges us to defend what we believe, and can sometimes expose fallacies in our thinking before they become disastrous. This is what Moore does; this is the obvious goal of Fahrenheit 9/11; not to provide some grand solution to one of the greatest, most complicated problems Western civilization has ever faced, but to ask the questions that will change the way we think about these things. So long as we actually believe in the two-dimensional cardboard cutouts of good and evil &#8211; rather than two complicated sides, both with complicated people pursuing real (and even laudable) goals &#8211; the &#8220;War on Terra&#8221; is doomed to failure. To date, very few have been asking questions; we have acted as sheep. We have done as we have been told. Our ignorance has been staggering.&#8221;</blockquote>

My personal beef with the film had to do with the credibility of some of the &#8220;facts&#8221; presented.  There are an infinite number of ways to interpret history.  Michael Moore&#8217;s alternate history of the past four years left me in bewilderment until I read this from a New York Times article entitled &#8221;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/20/movies/20SHEN.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5070&amp;en=c2ece818688c14ef&amp;ex=1088568000">Michael Moore Is Ready for His Close-Up</a>:&#8221;

<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">&#8220;Mr. Moore is readying for a conservative counterattack, saying he has created a political-style &#8220;war room&#8221; to offer an instant response to any assault on the film&#8217;s credibility. He has retained Chris Lehane, a Democratic Party strategist known as a master of the black art of &#8220;oppo,&#8221; or opposition research, used to discredit detractors. He also hired outside fact-checkers, led by a former general counsel of The New Yorker and a veteran member of that magazine&#8217;s legendary fact-checking team, to vet the film. And he is threatening to go one step further, saying he has consulted with lawyers who can bring defamation suits against anyone who maligns the film or damages his reputation.&#8221;</blockquote>

Personally, I think the movie is a must-see for any American citizen regardless of their political affiliation.  It bothers me to see people who have slandered the movie without watching it.  Regardless of how you feel about Michael Moore or how far right you lean, I think it&#8217;s an important film that raises a lot of valid questions about the people who run our country, Republicans and Democrats alike.
