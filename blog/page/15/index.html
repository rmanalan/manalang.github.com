  <div class="entry-content">I&#8217;ve been working on some new tricks for my session at <a href="http://www.oracle.com/openworld/index.html">Oracle Open World</a>.  A lot of the things I&#8217;ve come up with incorporate Web 2.0 buzz word compliant features into the PeopleSoft Portal&#8230; stuff like Ajax/DHTML rich client type of features.  I&#8217;ve also been trying to come up with simple, no-fuss, high-value customizations that our customers can easily implement on their own.  One of them is adding Markdown text filtering to the PeopleSoft Portal.

<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> is a&#8230;

<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">&#8220;&#8230;text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).&#8221;</blockquote>

With Markdown, we can write this:

      * Bullet 1<br />
      * Bullet 2<br />
      * Bullet 3<p>

to get this:

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>&lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Bullet 1&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Bullet 2&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Bullet 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</pre></div>
</div>


This is one of the many things you can do with Markdown.  For more examples, visit the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown Syntax page</a>.

Markdown is nothing new and has actually been around for since 2003.  It was created by the &#8220;Mac Pundit&#8221; <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">Jon Gruber</a>.  I classify Markdown (and other text filtering tools like it&#8230; i.e., <a href="http://textism.com/tools/textile/">Textile</a>) as a middle-of-the-road solution between editing HTML by hand and using a WYSIWYG editor.  Markdown makes it easy to generate HTML by writting plain-text documents with an intuitively simple text formatting syntax.

So what value does this bring to your PeopleSoft application?  Well, in the case of the PeopleSoft Portal, you can have editors edit content without having to know HTML.  Earlier releases of the portal did not include a WYSIWYG HTML editor like version 8.9 does, so Markdown is a good alternative for your content authors/editors.

<strong>Let&#8217;s look at an example</strong>

Before we start, to allow for simple and easy integration of Markdown within PeopleSoft, we should use the <a href="http://www.petebevin.com/archives/2005/01/03/markdown_in_java.html">MarkdownJ</a> library.  MarkdownJ is a Java port of Markdown.  PeopleSoft can natively call Java within PeopleCode and so utilizing MarkdownJ makes our life a lot easier.  To use MarkdownJ, you&#8217;ll need the <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/markdownj/markdownj-1.0.2b1-0.2.0.jar?download">MarkdownJ jar file</a> and <a href="http://www.eng.lsu.edu/mirrors/apache/ant/binaries/apache-ant-1.6.5-bin.zip">Apache Ant</a>.  After you&#8217;ve downloaded Apache Ant, extract the contents then look for the ant.jar file under the lib directory.  Copy both the markdown.jar and ant.jar to your PS_HOME/class directory on your PeopleSoft appserver.  You&#8217;ll need to cycle your appserver in order to load them into the JVM&#8217;s memory.

Once you have the libraries placed on the appserver, all it takes to call MarkdownJ from within PeopleCode is this:

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>Local JavaObject &amp;markdown = CreateJavaObject(&quot;com.petebevin.markdown.MarkdownProcessor&quot;);
Local string &amp;transformedText = &amp;markdown.markdown(&amp;someText);</pre></div>
</div>


You can take this little bit of code and apply it to any text based process you want.  In our example, however, we&#8217;ll look at applying Markdown to Pagelet Wizard.

Pagelet Wizard is PeopleSoft&#8217;s tool for creating pagelets (or the more widely used term, portlets).  It&#8217;s a simple three step process:

# Acquire data (Data Types/Sources)
# Transform data (Data Transformations)
# Publish pagelet/portlet

Pagelet Wizard comes with several data types/sources out of the box.  One of these is called the HTML data type.  With this data type, a user can create a portlet by simply writting HTML within Pagelet Wizard then publishing the contents to a portlet.  We&#8217;re going to clone the HTML data type as a &#8220;Text&#8221; data type.  To do this, go to

<code>Portal Administration &gt; Pagelets &gt; Pagelet Wizard &gt; Define Data Types &gt; Add</code>

Define your Data Type according to the graphic below:

<img src="/images/media_httpmanalangcomwpcontentpwdatatypesmlgif_eFhhAFaptCCzpDy.gif" alt="Markdown Text Filtering for PeopleSoft" />

One thing you won&#8217;t be able to specify in the picture above is the CSS_MARKDOWN display format.  We&#8217;ll have to come back to that later.  Data Types define the source of the data you want to acquire for your portlet.  When you create a new Tata Type, you&#8217;ll need to specify the PeopleCode application class you want to use that will source the data.  In this case, our data type is similar to the HTML data type in that we&#8217;re sourcing the data directly from user input within Pagelet Wizard in the form of a text area.  So, we&#8217;re going to just refer to the app class for the HTML data source.

Next, we need to define a Transform Type.  Navigate to:

<code>Portal Administration &gt; Pagelets &gt; Pagelet Wizard &gt; Define Transform Types &gt; Add</code>

Again, create a new Transformation Type with the following properties:

<img src="/images/media_httpmanalangcomwpcontentpwtransformtypesmlgif_ohiixjbFDlzpwts.gif" alt="Markdown Text Filtering for PeopleSoft" />

A Transformation Type defines a transformation processor.  In this case, our transformation processor is MarkdownJ.  A Transformation Type requires an app class that will take your Data Type output and convert it to the format you want.  In this case, we will have to roll up our sleeves and write a little PeopleCode.  For your convenience, here&#8217;s <a href="http://manalang.com/wp-content/CSS_RLM_PW_MARKDOWN_TRANSFORM.zip">a project</a> you can import into your database.  And just for reference, here&#8217;s what the code in the app class looks like (I cloned the PTPPB_PAGELET:Transformer:PassthroughTransformer class to build the Markdown transformer):

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>import PTPPB_PAGELET:UTILITY:*;
import PTPPB_PAGELET:Transformer:*;
import PTPPB_PAGELET:*;

/**
  * Transformer that performs a Markdown transform.
  */
class MarkdownTransformer extends PTPPB_PAGELET:Transformer:Transformer
   method MarkdownTransformer(&amp;ID_param As string);
   method execute(&amp;pageletID As string) Returns string;
   method Clone() Returns PTPPB_PAGELET:Transformer:Transformer;
end-class;

/**
  * Constructor.
  *
  * @param id_param ID of this object.  Should be unique.
  */
method MarkdownTransformer
   /+ &amp;ID_param as String +/
   %Super = create PTPPB_PAGELET:Transformer:Transformer(&amp;ID_param);
end-method;

/**
  * Calls MarkdownJ to process Markdown filtering
  *
  * @param pageletID ID of the pagelet being executed.
  */
method execute
   /+ &amp;pageletID as String +/
   /+ Returns String +/
   /+ Extends/implements PTPPB_PAGELET:Transformer:Transformer.execute +/
   Local JavaObject &amp;markdown = CreateJavaObject(&quot;com.petebevin.markdown.MarkdownProcessor&quot;);
   Local string &amp;transformedText = &amp;markdown.markdown(%This.DataToTransform.Value);
   Return ?
end-method;

/**
  * Make an exact copy of this object.
  *
  * @return Text Exact copy of this object
  */
method Clone
   /+ Returns PTPPB_PAGELET:Transformer:Transformer +/
   /+ Extends/implements PTPPB_PAGELET:Transformer:Transformer.Clone +/
   Return create PTPPB_PAGELET:Transformer:PassthroughTransformer(%This.ID);
end-method;</pre></div>
</div>


Lastly, you&#8217;ll need to define a new Display Format.  Navigate to:

<code>Portal Administration &gt; Pagelets &gt; Pagelet Wizard &gt; Define Display Formats &gt; Add</code>

<img src="/images/media_httpmanalangcomwpcontentpwdisplayformatssmlgif_ivjrhbJFyzxwbiG.gif" alt="Markdown Text Filtering for PeopleSoft" />

A Display Format is a subclass of a Transformation Type.  For example, an XSL Transformation Type can have a number of Display Types.  A few delivered Display Types for XSL are chart, list, table, etc.  In our case, we will only have one Display Type with Markdown.

Once you&#8217;ve define the Transformation Type and the Display Format, go back into your Markup Data Type page and add the Markup Display Format.  The list of Display Formats in the Data Type page allows you to apply other Display Format/Transformation Types to a data source.

Once you&#8217;ve done all of that, you can now create a new text based pagelet by selecting the &#8220;Text&#8221; Data Type.  When you get to step 4, select Markdown.  At step 5 you&#8217;ll see your text after the Markdown transformation is applied.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">This was forwarded to me (and hundreds of others).  It&#8217;s too interesting not to post (even if it&#8217;s not entirely accurate).  Can anyone comment on the accuracy of this?

<blockquote>Abraham Lincoln was elected to Congress in 1846.
John F. Kennedy was elected to Congress in 1946.

Abraham Lincoln was elected President in 1860.
John F. Kennedy was elected President in 1960.

Both were particularly concerned with civil rights.
Both wives lost their children while living in the White House.

Both Presidents were shot on a Friday.
Both Presidents were shot in the head.

Now it gets really weird.

Lincoln&#8217;s secretary was named Kennedy.
Kennedy&#8217;s Secretary was named Lincoln.

Both were assassinated by Southerners.
Both were succeeded by Southerners named Johnson.

Andrew Johnson, who succeeded Lincoln, was born in 1808.
Lyndon Johnson, who succeeded Kennedy, was born in 1908.

John Wilkes Booth, who assassinated Lincoln, was born in 1839.
Lee Harvey Oswald, who assassinated Kennedy, was born in 1939.

Both assassins were known by their three names.
Both names are composed of fifteen letters.

Now hang on to your seat.

Lincoln was shot at the theater named &#8216;Ford.&#8217;
Kennedy was shot in a car called &#8216;Lincoln&#8217; made by &#8216;Ford.&#8217;

Lincoln was shot in a theater and his assassin ran and hid in a warehouse.
Kennedy was shot from a warehouse and his assassin ran and hid in a theater.

Booth and Oswald were assassinated before their trials.

And here&#8217;s the kicker&#8230;

A week before Lincoln was shot, he was in Monroe, Maryland
A week before Kennedy was shot, he was with Marilyn Monroe.

  <div class="entry-content">Larry Grey, for those of you who don&#8217;t know him, was PeopleSoft&#8217;s expert and visionary for reporting and business intelligence.

  <div class="entry-content"><a href="http://www.nickwalton.com/">Nick Walton</a> wrote in with a patch to fix <a href="http://manalang.com/archives/2004/06/23/wordpress-plugin-wp-amazon/">WP-Amazon</a> due to <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2005/07/new_ecs_release.html">a change Amazon made to their web service</a>.  Because Amazon changed their XML format for search results, the images in the WP-Amazon search results page were no longer appearing.  The new version of WP-Amazon that fixes this can be downloaded <a href="http://manalang.com/wp-content/wp-amazon-1.3.1.zip">here</a>.

Just a bit of commentary from my point of view&#8230; Amazon should have tagged these changes under a different version so that applications that rely on a particular format (like WP-Amazon) don&#8217;t break.  I&#8217;m looking into why that didn&#8217;t happen.

<strong>Update:</strong> I found <a href="http://forums.prospero.com/n/mb/message.asp?webtag=am-assocdevxml&amp;msg=9280.1&amp;ctx=0">this</a> in the Amazon ECS forums.  So, WP-Amazon 1.3.1 now specifies &#8220;version&#8221; query parameter in all of its REST requests to prevent this from happening again.

  <div class="entry-content">Those of you who know me, know that I used to work for PeopleSoft (up until we got acquired by Oracle).  Now, I work at Oracle.  At PeopleSoft, I used to have an internal blog that focused on the products I worked on (PeopleSoft Enterprise Portal and general PeopleSoft tools and technology&#8230; PeopleTools and the like) targeted for employees in the field.  The title of the blog was<em> &#8220;Sales Geekery: A weblog by technology nerds dedicated to hacking, evangelizing, and selling PeopleSoft technology&#8221;</em>.  Much of what I wrote focused on how-to topics.  I&#8217;ve always thought that it would be useful for customers to see the information I wrote about, but at the time PeopleSoft didn&#8217;t have an official blogging policy and most employees who had blogs internally were a bit shy about writing for a public audience &#8211; probably because of the competetive nature of the ERP industry.

Fast forward to today.  I&#8217;m now an Oracle employee.  There are a number of <a href="http://www.orablogs.com/orablogs/">Oracle employees who blog publicly</a>, although, apparently we don&#8217;t have a public blog policy at Oracle.  I did, however, talk with <a href="http://www.orablogs.com/duffblog/">Brian Duff</a> (the creator of <a href="http://www.orablogs.com/orablogs/">Orablogs</a>) and he did say that Oracle&#8217;s corporate communications policy applies to blogging just as it does to customer communications.  Apparently, there was talk about putting together an official Oracle blogging policy about a year ago.

So, I&#8217;m going to try a little experiment here.  I&#8217;m going to start writing articles here similar in nature to the ones I wrote on my internal PeopleSoft blog.  I think it&#8217;ll be helpful for customers who use our products and a good vehicle for sharing information within the PeopleSoft developer community.  So, if you&#8217;re a PeopleSoft developer, stay tuned.

  <div class="entry-content">For those of you who use my <a href="http://manalang.com/archives/2005/05/25/ta-da-list-greased-up/">Ta-Da List Greasemonkey script</a> or <a href="http://manalang.com/archives/2004/06/23/wordpress-plugin-wp-amazon/">WP-Amazon</a>, you might be interested to know that there are new versions available as of today.  First, I&#8217;ve added an options page on WP-Amazon that allows you to specify a default country, add your associate ID, and change the subscription ID &#8211; so you no longer need to change the code.  You can download the latest version <a href="http://manalang.com/wp-content/wp-amazon-1.3.zip">here</a>.

As for the Ta-Da List Greasemonkey script&#8230; for those of you who haven&#8217;t been keeping up with Greasemonkey, a few weeks ago, <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2005/07/20/vulnerability">a major security hole was found</a> and so the Greasemonkey developers released a new version which disabled a few features.  One of those features was one that my script relied on.  So, if you happen to have <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">the latest Greasemonkey extension (version 0.3.5)</a>, I&#8217;ve updated the script so it no longer relies on the Greasemonkey GM_xmlhttprequest function.  You can download the new script <a href="http://manalang.com/greasemonkey/ta-da_list.user.js">here</a>.

This time it&#8217;s about how software companies are made by the quality of their programmers.  It sounds obvious, but in today&#8217;s world of outsourced programming, software companies should really step back and look at the quality of their workers.  Joel starts off with this premise:

<table border="0" align="center" style="text-align: center; border: 0; margin-top: 0; padding-top: 0;"><tr><td style="border: 1px solid black;">Best Working Conditions</td><td style="font-size: 200%; border: 0;">?</td><td style="border: 1px solid black;">Best Programmers</td><td style="font-size: 200%; border: 0;">?</td><td style="border: 1px solid black;">Best Software</td><td style="font-size: 200%; border: 0;">?</td><td style="border: 1px solid black;">Profit!</td></tr></table>

<a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/">Fog Creek Software</a>, a company Joel started, was founded based on this theory.  Joel&#8217;s article dives into some nice proof points that show that better programmers are more productive and are more likely come up with innovations that mediocre programmers will unlikely be able to come up with themselves.

<blockquote>The real trouble with using a lot of mediocre programmers instead of a couple of good ones is that no matter how long they work, they never produce something as good as what the great programmers can produce.

Five Antonio Salieris won&#8217;t produce Mozart&#8217;s Requiem. Ever. Not if they work for 100 years.

&#8230;

The Creative Zen team could spend years refining their ugly iPod knockoffs and never produce as beautiful, satisfying, and elegant a player as the Apple iPod. And they&#8217;re not going to make a dent in Apple&#8217;s market share because the magical design talent is just not there. They don&#8217;t have it.

The mediocre talent just never hits the high notes that the top talent hits all the time. The number of divas who can hit the f6 in Mozart&#8217;s Queen of the Night is vanishingly small, and you just can&#8217;t perform The Queen of the Night without that famous f6.</blockquote>

A great read, as usual, from Joel.

  <div class="entry-content">As I was updating <a href="http://manalang.com/archives/2004/06/23/wordpress-plugin-wp-amazon/">WP-Amazon</a> this morning in response to <a href="http://manalang.com/archives/2004/06/23/wordpress-plugin-wp-amazon/#comment-2473">this comment</a>, I noticed that I released WP-Amazon to the world on June 23 last year.  So, to celebrate, here&#8217;s a new release: <a href="http://manalang.com/wp-content/wp-amazon-1.2.8.zip">WP-Amazon 1.2.8</a>.  This is a minor release that changes the Amazon link to a button within the Quicktags region&#8230; this makes the plugin usable using the <a href="http://www.orderedlist.com/articles/wordpress-administration-design-tiger/">Tiger Style Administration plugin</a>.

Thanks to all who use the plugin and have helped me make it better!

  <div class="entry-content">Over the past week, I&#8217;ve been spending some time learning <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>.  My real interest is in <a href="http://www.jython.org">Jython</a>, the Python interpreter for Java, but there&#8217;s no difference in language semantics so it&#8217;s just like learning Python.  Earlier this week, I ran into the <a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~nvawter/projects/googlemaps/">&#8220;Google Map Hack for Large Maps&#8221;</a> in my <a href="http://del.icio.us/popular/">del.icio.us/popular</a> feed.  This is a great way to build poster sized maps using Google&#8217;s map images.  Noah Vawter, the original author of the hack wrote a Perl based script that downloads Google Maps&#8217; tile images based on a location you feed then stitches them together to make a giant image.  I decided to take his Perl script and rewrite it as <a href="http://dev.manalang.com/Jython/google_map_stitcher.py">a Jython script</a>.  It&#8217;ll actually work in Python with some minor modifications to the code.  If you want to use this script, you&#8217;ll need Jython and <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php">ImageMagick</a>.  Noah&#8217;s Perl script relies on wget&#8230; my script uses Python&#8217;s urllib to grab the images and save them&#8230; so no need for wget.  Enjoy!
