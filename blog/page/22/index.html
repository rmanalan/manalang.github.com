  <div class="entry-content">The W3C has a discussion note about <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/photo-rdf/" title="Describing and retrieving photos using RDF and HTTP">how RDF can be used to describe photos</a>.  I have a problem with this.  A few weeks ago, I wrote about &#8221;<a href="http://manalang.com/archives/2003/10/01/why_exif_is_so_important.php">Why EXIF is so Important</a>.&#8221;  The discussion note doesn&#8217;t factor in EXIF data in any way.  The JPEG images that result from today&#8217;s digital cameras all contain rich meta data about a photo.  This article doesn&#8217;t mention how that EXIF data can be used as a basis for better search, retrieval, and cataloging of images.  Although, currently most cameras today only produce EXIF data about technical details of a picture, I don&#8217;t think EXIF should be abandoned in favor or RDF.  The big benefit of EXIF is the fact that the meta data is tied directly to the image.  If the image is shared, moved, or copied, the meta data is still there.  I know that EXIF data is fragile and can be changed, deleted and tampered with using different imaging applications, but assuming that it isn&#8217;t, I think it&#8217;s the best way for data to live with the image.

  <div class="entry-content"><a href="http://ask.yahoo.com/ask/20031031.html" title="Where does the flushed waste from airplane toilets go while in flight?">Where does the flushed waste from airplane toilets go while in flight?</a>  I&#8217;ve always wondered about this.  Thanks to <a href="http://ask.yahoo.com">Ask Yahoo!</a> now I know.

<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Recently, an unlucky resident of Santa Cruz, California, received a special blue ice delivery courtesy of an American Airlines plane right through the skylight of his boat. He took the airline to small claims court and won a modest sum. A Pittsburgh woman&#8217;s home was also subject to such a delivery. Other folks describe mysterious biological material that appears splattered around their houses and property.</blockquote>

I don&#8217;t understand how the airlines can get away with dumping human feces out into the sky.  There&#8217;s something wrong with this.  It&#8217;s bad enough that from time to time, some innocent bystander can get struck by some bird turd falling out of the sky.  To get pummeled by some &#8220;brown goo&#8221; sounds a hell of a lot worse.

  <div class="entry-content">I was getting a little tired of how my site looked so I decided a redesign was in order.  There are still some kinks with some browsers and the search page is still a little screwed up&#8230; so, bear with me.  Also, I haven&#8217;t validated my CSS yet&#8230; not sure if it will validate right now.  I&#8217;m hoping that this design will force me to take pictures more often so I can have a new masthead image every other posting or so.  Anyway, what do you think&#8230; honestly?

  <div class="entry-content">I settled in with the penguin several months ago when I decided to put up this <a href="http://www.redhat.com" title="Red Hat">Red Hat</a> webserver.  However, this webserver is just that, a server.  I don&#8217;t use it as a desktop&#8230; it&#8217;s strictly an HTTP server.  I&#8217;ve been itching for a different operating system for a while now.  Currently, I run Windows 2000 and XP Pro at work and Windows XP Pro at home.  I&#8217;m tired of Windows.  Years ago, I used to have a Mac (LC II).  I loved it, until it was obselete.  Then after college, I moved to OS2 with Windows emulation (yeah, the company I was working for just didn&#8217;t get it&#8230; I remember a paper memo the CIO sent out stating that the &#8220;Internet was a passing fad&#8221; and that it was not going to be &#8220;an important technology in business&#8221;).  Then after a few years, I was living in a Microsoft world.  It was cool for a while.  But now, I&#8217;m itching for something more.

So, since I don&#8217;t have any other machines to play around with and don&#8217;t care to pump money into <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> for one of thier spiffy looking Macs, I&#8217;ve decided to take the poor man&#8217;s approach to making a &#8220;Switch&#8221;&#8230; I decided to take the <a href="http://www.knoppix.net/">Knoppix</a> route.

Knoppix is a Linux distrubution that&#8217;s bootable from a CD-ROM.  All you have to do is download the ISO image from their <a href="http://www.knoppix.net/">website</a>, burn it to a CD, then boot your machine from that CD.  The amazing thing is it boots faster than Windows 2000 on my laptop.  Most of the software I need is already installed and configured&#8230; even Wi-Fi support works the first time I turned it on!  And if you&#8217;re itching to add other apps or change the config a bit, you can store your configuration onto another device like a compact flash card (which I already happen to have for my laptop).

This is definitely the poor man&#8217;s approach to making a switch, but the nice part is I don&#8217;t have to dump $2,500 USD for a <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/index15.html">15&#8221; PowerBook</a> and have to regret it later when it&#8217;s obselete.  Computers are like cars.  They depreciate the minute they come of that showroom floor.

  <div class="entry-content"><a href="http://cornwall.backtalk.com/">Frank Leahy&#8217;s</a> post on <a href="http://cornwall.backtalk.com/archives/000062.html">How to Make Photos More Searchable</a> got me thinking about the future of digital photography.  With digital cameras enabling people to take more photos than ever, it&#8217;s going to be more important to have some way to organize those photos beyond having fancy software like <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshopalbum/overview.html">Adobe&#8217;s Photoshop Album</a>.  The one promising aspect of digital photos produced by most digital cameras today is the <a href="http://www.exif.org">EXIF</a> data it produces.  EXIF data is typically comprised of the technical data about the photo such as shutter speed, aperture, date/time it was taken, etc.  However, it can also contain data like the GPS coordinates of where the photo was taken and also comments the photographer might have about the scene.  Imagine a digital camera that knew where the picture was taken.  All of this stored inside the image file.

I might have hinted about the benefits of EXIF in <a href="http://manalang.com/archives/2003/09/29/file_system_generated_photo_gallery.html">my previous post</a>, but to explain further, making good use of EXIF data gives digital photography enthusiasts a great way to catalog and archive their photos.  It will also enable them to search through these archives better without the need for complex software or databases.

Making use of EXIF data in my photos is my current pursuit.  Now that I&#8217;ve got a <a href="http://manalang.com/photos/">gallery</a> that displays my photos EXIF data.  I am looking at creating a PHP application that will allow me to edit the user comments attribute of a photo&#8217;s EXIF data.  Currently, I&#8217;m looking at using <a href="http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/jhead/" title="Exif Jpeg camera setting parser and thumbnail remover">jhead</a> to be able to write to the EXIF headers of an image since PHP currently only supports reading from the headers.  If that doesn&#8217;t work, I plan on just using software to edit the EXIF data.  <a href="http://www.stuffware.co.uk/photostudio/" title="Photo Studio">Photo Studio</a> is a free application that will allow me to view and edit my EXIF data before posting the photo on the web.

I&#8217;m hoping that more software and hardware vendors begin to take EXIF seriously and realize its potential for enhancing the digital photography experience.  The promise of digital photography shouldn&#8217;t be just about the image.  The data that supports that image is just as important.

  <div class="entry-content">A few months ago, I installed <a href="http://gallery.menalto.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=index">Gallery</a> on this server in hopes to have a decent way to publish my photos to the web.  After playing with it for a day, I realized that it wasn&#8217;t a good fit for me.  I have thousands of photos I&#8217;ve kept on my desktop since 1999 (the day I got my first digital camera).   I never really spent much time publishing any of them on the web except for a few random shots on <a href="http://photos.yahoo.com">Yahoo! Photos</a> &#8211; but that really doesn&#8217;t satisfy my needs either.  Here&#8217;s what I want in a photo gallery:

# Easy photo publishing
# Automatically generated thumbnails
# Automatically resized photos appropriate for the web
# Easy to customize (<a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">standards based</a>) UI
# <a href="http://www.exif.org/">EXIF</a> data display

Gallery can do 2-3, but falls short on 1 and 4.  It can also do 5, but not the way I&#8217;m interested in.
