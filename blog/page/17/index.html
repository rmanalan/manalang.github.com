  <div class="entry-content"><img src="/images/media_httpwwwflickrco_lfbGh.jpg" alt="A Few Enhancements" />

Since getting my <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/nikond70/">D70</a> on Friday, my love for photography has been renewed.  I started taking photos back in high school (for the yearbook).  Back then, I used my dad&#8217;s Pentax K1000.  Then after college, I bought myself a Nikon N80 (<a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;category=15238&amp;item=3856746697&amp;rd=1&amp;ssPageName=WDVW">now for sale</a>) along with four great lenses (50mm/f1.8, 24mm/f2.8, 24-120mm/f3.5-5.6, 17-35/f3.5-5.6) and a bunch of other crap.  All in all, a big investment.  I took a lot of great pictures with that camera, but with the money I spent on film, development (including my own time in the lab developing my own pictures), I could have bought myself a nice DSLR.  But at the time, there hadn&#8217;t been a good DSLR that fit the right price-point, at least, not until the D70.

Anyway, since getting the D70, I&#8217;ve decided to revive my blog so I can post more photos.  So, a few changes were in order.  I&#8217;ve always had the masthead photo viewer on the top of the blog.  The problem was that none of those masthead entries made it onto the feeds.  That&#8217;s no longer a problem.  All of my feeds now include the masthead postings.

Also, I&#8217;ve added a new sidebar item that displays the four most recent <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/manalang/">flickr</a> photos I&#8217;ve posted.  I love flickr!

I never wanted to have to maintain a separate photo blog.  So, for those of you who could care less about my photos, sorry.

  <div class="entry-content">I just read Eric Meyer&#8217;s general feelings about the results of the recent election (<a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2004/11/09/behind-the-beauty-cracks-appear/">Behind The Beauty, Cracks Appear</a>).  Like lots of others, I was most shocked with the eleven states that decided to reject gay marriage.  These Americans (including Bush) are trying to &#8220;protect&#8221; the institution of marriage.  My question is what are they trying to protect it from?

Consider this &#8211; most marriages in America end in divorce.  Certainly, the conservatives who want to &#8220;protect&#8221; marriage aren&#8217;t trying to protect it from that.  How many times has Jennifer Lopez been married?  And wasn&#8217;t Britney Spears married for just one day this year?  This doesn&#8217;t happen with just the pop stars.  I&#8217;m sure many people who voted against gay marriage have been divorced before.

Another thing, apparently somewhere in the Bible, marriage is defined to be between a man and a woman.  I&#8217;m not saying I doubt this (I&#8217;m by no means a theology expert)&#8230; I&#8217;m sure the Bible does say that.  However, where in the Koran does it say that?  How about the Jewish Bible?  Or some other religion&#8217;s holy scripture?  The point is, if America is a pluralist nation tolerant of everyone&#8217;s beliefs, why would the government impose policies that force you to live your life a certain way?  In fact, I&#8217;m beginning to think that the government should get out of the business of marrying people.  The fact is, it&#8217;s generally accepted that two people in union are better than one.  And so, the American government should bestow its citizens the right for two people to join in a civil union.  But if you want to get married, in your traditional sense of what marriage is, go to a church or a place where you can have that deed bestowed upon you.

I understand that most of the citizens of the eleven states who decided to ban gay marriage may not have had much exposure or experience with gay couples before.  I also understand that the first image that comes to mind when they think of gay people is often disturbing.  And it&#8217;s probably because of this ignorance that these people decided to define the way gay Americans should live their life.  This same ignorance and hypocrisy divided our country back in the civil rights days.  Think of all the mixed race married couples you know and consider to be friends today.  It wasn&#8217;t too long ago when mixed race couples were prevented by the government from marrying &#8211; 1967 to be exact:

<blockquote>&#8220;The freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.&#8221; (US Supreme Court: <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=388&amp;invol=1">Loving v. Virginia</a>, 1967. This was the ruling that allowed mixed-race marriages throughout the U.S.).</blockquote>

Ignorance and hypocrisy was the problem back then and it&#8217;s the same problem today.  The point is, maybe the government should stop marrying people and start giving out civil unions instead.  Marriage, as it&#8217;s performed today, is not always religious anyway.  And so, why should religion impose on gay couples who want to join in union just so they can benefit in the same rights given to married heterosexual couples?

  <div class="entry-content"><strong>General Public Announcement:</strong> <a href="http://manalang.com/archives/2004/06/23/wordpress-plugin-wp-amazon/">WP-Amazon goes to version 1.2</a>!

This release is packed with all sorts of good sh*t.  About a month ago, maybe more, Amazon released a new version of their web service &#8211; it&#8217;s now called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/aws/sdk/104-4069893-5939952?">Amazon E-Commerce Service 4.0</a>.  Although, they still only support four countries (US, UK, DE, and JP), they&#8217;ve added lots of good stuff including the ability to perform a blended search across all of their product search indices.  This makes it much easier to search for products since you no longer need to know which area of Amazon to search.

In my opinion, the most interesting feature Amazon added to their service is the ability to search for restaurants (US only).  Amazon is now indexing restaurant menus and tracking customer reviews and other great information (address, phone numbers, price range, map, etc.)  I&#8217;ve added this feature in WP-Amazon so that you can now include a link and image of a restaurant menu to your blog entries.  Here&#8217;s how that looks in WP-Amazon:

<img src="/images/media_httpmanalangcomwpcontentwpamazonrestaurantsgif_CJnxtscoghljbIl.gif" alt="WP-Amazon 1.2" />

After a restaurant has been selected, you can select how you want link to the restaurant information:

<img src="/images/media_httpmanalangcomwpcontentwpamazonrestaurantslinkgif_cGnqCqddAntlyjq.gif" alt="WP-Amazon 1.2" />

I&#8217;ve also added the ability to search across different Amazon country sites (currently, the Amazon API only supports the US, United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan).  Also, I refactored the code so that it no longer relies on NuSOAP.  Instead, it now uses REST and PHP&#8217;s native support for XML.

<a href="http://manalang.com/archives/2004/06/23/wordpress-plugin-wp-amazon/">Kick the tires</a>, then let me know if it works.

  <div class="entry-content">Yesterday, I posted <a href="http://manalang.com/archives/2004/09/19/the-home-computer-of-2004/">this entry on &#8220;The Home Computer of 2004&#8221;</a> and somehow caught the eye of the popular <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/09/19.html#a8254">Robert Scoble</a>.  Overnight, Scoble&#8217;s blog sent me lots of visitors &#8211; thanks!  However, one of the things I failed to do is properly attribute where I got the link from (I got it from <a href="http://del.icio.us/popular/">del.icio.us/popular</a> &#8211; the original image came from <a href="http://users.net1plus.com/scottm/HomeComputer.jpg">here</a>&#8230; from some guy named <a href="http://users.net1plus.com/scottm/">Scott</a>).  It turns out the image I posted is a hoax&#8230; who knew (lots of people I guess).  The funny thing is, even if I would have properly attributed who I got the photo from, I bet Scoble would still have linked to it.  Afterall, there&#8217;s no indication from the original source that it was a hoax.  Anyway, this morning, <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/09/20.html#a8255">Scoble decided to dump me because of my false reporting</a>.  Mr. Scoble, I didn&#8217;t mean to ruin your credibility, really.

Does this mean, I have to research everything I write before posting it like a journalist would do?  Maybe, but I don&#8217;t think so.  My purpose of having a blog is so that I can keep a living journal of things that interest me.  I&#8217;m not a paid journalist, nor am I a <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2082741/">Jason Blair</a>.  I have no responsibilities to reporting accurately for people like Scoble.  Is it my fault for posting this hoax as if it were fact?  Maybe.  I&#8217;m not one to mislead people intentionally.  In this case, I&#8217;m the one who was misled.

And believe me, my post had nothing to do with Robert Scoble&#8217;s theory on &#8221;<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/09/19.html#a8241">How your blog will get discovered</a>.&#8221;
